Parsing C program to sort exel file

The program read in a user entered file and places it in a 3d array. It uses the Header and first column of the file as the place where the Species names will be.

It then uses the relationship values that link the 2 names and prints the names of the related speries to a file.

Limitations for this program is that it's semi-broken. The user will have to edit the file so that everything is on one line. Then they will run the program and enter the number of names and columns for the program to seperate correctly.
